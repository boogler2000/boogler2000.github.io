	<H1>Cinema In The Age of Television</H1>
	</div>
		
		<p><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good movie is beautiful. There's just something about it. Wether it's Stanly Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Casino, or Grand Budapest Hotel. You can feel it in the core of the film, you can smell it in the structure, in every frame. Smells like cinema, damn it... But recently I've been picking up this scent on movie's idiot step-brother; television. Television shows in the 21st century have picked up some serious slack, and are now closing the quality gap. But how are they doing it? And an even better question; what qualifies something as "cinematic"?  </b> 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Cinematic” is one of those few mystery words, a word of which you understand the meaning of, but can’t seem to give anyone a meaningful definition of. Like love. Ah yes, cinema is like love. It’s like watching a shitty horror sequel, and knowing that you’ll never be able to get the 2 hours that Sharknado 3 just stole from you, or like watching Martin Scorsese’s Casino and wishing that it would just never end. But to keep things simple we’re just going to define it as “quality”. So what’s been giving modern TV such quality? Pretty simply: money. There’s a market for it. People want to crave Sunday’s at 10:30 so they can flip over to FX and find out what’s going to happen to Paperboy’s rap career. I wish there were a better answer but money rules in the world of art.  </b>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Money, money, money baby. That’s what I want! Anything from the camera, to the director, to the actors, you’re going to want to shell out. It’s like strippers, the more money you’re willing to shell out, the better performance you’re likely to get. So over the last few decades television has been slowly evolving while costing, and grossing more. With major players like HBO, Cinemax, and StarTime leading the TV revolution with quality shows that outplay most of the box office SHIT that the majority gobbles up, it’s hard to look away.
